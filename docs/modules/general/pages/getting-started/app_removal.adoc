= Clean Removal of a Custom App

To remove a previously loaded custom app:

* Remove the app's service definition from `docker-compose.yaml`.
* Delete any related import files (microfrontends, microservices, products, permissions) from the `imports` folders.
* Remove menu entries and product references from the `onecx_admin.json`.
* Re-import the data and restart the environment to ensure the app is fully removed by running:
[source,sh]
----
./import-onecx.sh
