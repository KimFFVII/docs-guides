= Manual Image Build
To avoid caching issues and ensure the latest code is used, it is recommended to manually build the Docker image after building your app locally.

For that first go to your application and *remove the cache and dist folder to avoid using cached images*:

[source,sh]
----
rm -rf .nx/cache ./dist
----

Then you can build your application and create a local docker image:

[source,sh]
----
npm run build
docker build --no-cache -t helloworld_local .
----

The local images need to be added to your `.env` file in the onecx-local-env as shown xref:automatic-image-build[above], but the UI should refer to the locally built image:

[source,env]
----
HELLO_WORLD_SVC=${DOCKER_REPO}/hello-world-svc:main-native
HELLO_WORLD_BFF=${DOCKER_REPO}/hello-world-bff:main-native
HELLO_WORLD_UI=helloworld_local:latest
----

Now you can also import the initial data by running:

[source,sh]
----
./import-onecx.sh
----

and start the service with:

[source,sh]
----
docker compose -f hello-world.docker-compose.yml --profile base up -d
----

Now the local image is used and changes in the application should be reflected under `http://local-proxy/mfe/helloWorld/hello` after rebuilding the image of the application.
